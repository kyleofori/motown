<p> You wake up on a tiny beach surrounded by skyscrapers. Your head is pounding,
  and you have no idea what is going on. "Where am I?" you mutter aloud.
   "Campus Martius Park," barks a deep male voice from behind you. "And you can't stay here, either."
   <br /> To the south, you see a lot of construction on the road; to the north, there's a funky looking
   wide building that seems to take up the whole block. <br />
